# Ollama Deep Researcher - Arxiv

UPDATE:
> This is a fork of [Langchain's excellent example of Deep Researcher using DeepSeek-r1 Locally](https://github.com/langchain-ai/ollama-deep-researcher)
> This version has been modified to search on arxiv.org instead of Tavily or Perplexity.

Ollama Deep Researcher is a fully local web research assistant that uses any LLM hosted by [Ollama](https://ollama.com/search). Give it a topic and it will generate a arxiv search query, gather research papers (via [Arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/) by default), summarize the results of the recovered papers, reflect on the summary to examine knowledge gaps, generate a new search query to address the gaps, search, and improve the summary for a user-defined number of cycles. It will provide the user a final markdown summary with all sources used.

## ðŸš€ Quickstart

### Mac / Linux

1. Download the Ollama app for Mac [here](https://ollama.com/download).

2. Pull a local LLM from [Ollama](https://ollama.com/search). As an [example](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1:8b): 
```bash
ollama pull deepseek-r1:8b
```

3. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cerebraljam/ollama-deep-researcher.git
cd ollama-deep-researcher
```

4. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

5. Launch the assistant with the LangGraph server:

```bash
# Install uv package manager
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uvx --refresh --from "langgraph-cli[inmem]" --with-editable . --python 3.11 langgraph dev
```

### Using the LangGraph Studio UI 

When you launch LangGraph server, you should see the following output and Studio will open in your browser:
> Ready!
> 
> API: http://127.0.0.1:2024
> 
> Docs: http://127.0.0.1:2024/docs
> 
> LangGraph Studio Web UI: https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024

Open `LangGraph Studio Web UI` via the URL in the output above. 

In the `configuration` tab:
* Set the name of your local LLM to use with Ollama (it will by default be `llama3.2`) 
* You can set the depth of the research iterations (it will by default be `3`)

Give the assistant a topic for research, and you can visualize its process!

## How it works

This is a for of [Langchain's Ollama Deep Researcher tool](https://github.com/langchain-ai/ollama-deep-researcher). It is inspired by [IterDRAG](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.04343v1#:~:text=To%20tackle%20this%20issue%2C%20we,used%20to%20generate%20intermediate%20answers.). This approach will decompose a query into sub-queries, retrieve documents for each one, answer the sub-query, and then build on the answer by retrieving docs for the second sub-query. Here, we do similar:
- Given a user-provided topic, use a local LLM (via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/search)) to generate a web search query
- Uses the arxiv library to search for relevant research papers
- Uses LLM to summarize the findings from web search related to the user-provided research topic
- Then, it uses the LLM to reflect on the summary, identifying knowledge gaps
- It generates a new search query to address the knowledge gaps
- The process repeats, with the summary being iteratively updated with other research papers
- It will repeat down the research rabbit hole 
- Runs for a configurable number of iterations (see `configuration` tab)  

## Outputs

The output of the graph is a markdown file containing the research summary, with citations to the sources used.

All sources gathered during research are saved to the graph state. 

You can visualize them in the graph state, which is visible in LangGraph Studio:

The final summary is saved to the graph state as well:

## Deployment Options

There are [various ways](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/#deployment-options) to deploy this graph.

See [Module 6](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-academy/tree/main/module-6) of LangChain Academy for a detailed walkthrough of deployment options with LangGraph.
